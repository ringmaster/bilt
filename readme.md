# Bilt

Bilt is a tool that takes some common javascript libraries and a CSS framework and compiles them into a single javascript file that injects them all into a page.

The ultimate goal is to be able to add a single line like this to a page to have access to the entirety of the libraries:

`<script src="bilt.js"></script>`
